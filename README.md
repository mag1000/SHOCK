# SHOCK
Structured High-Order Computational Kernel

At the Shockwave Laboratory in Aachen (Germany), SHOCK [CFD Software (Direct Numerical Simulation)] was developed by Dipl.Ing. Manuel Gageik on the base of the code of Prof. Igor Klioutchnikov.
In docs/, the governing equations, numerical scheme and features of this code are described.
In libs/, the additional libraries are availble.
The source files are in src/
